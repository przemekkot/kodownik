# kodownik
A kodownik is a book with cashier codes.

Cashier codes are numbers up to 5 digits. Each number
represents a product in a store that has no barcode.
Those a fruits, breads, buns, cakes, meat or even a product
with a barcode.
Those are often random codes, divided into categories.

Cashier to be efficient has to memorize them.
This application's goal is to help do this.

The idea is simple:
* code has to be displayed
* product name for that code has to be displayed
* it would be good if a photo of product also be displayed
* codes will be randomly(with even distribution) selected
* user will be pressing highlighted numbers on screen keyboard
that reasembles the cash register screen keyboard
* button that has to be pressed will be highlighted
* each button will have different color when pressed, double pressed, tripple...

User will be remembering:
* code
* product name
* hand movement
* color pattern
* if code will be read by user - also sound

Proper code's distribution, short learning sessions should boost speed of learning.
